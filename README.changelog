     10/21/95:  Changed class structure _and_ _data_ _files_ to name the
		logical model correctly.  Logical model items now start
		with "lm-", and the logical model is called "logical-model".

     10/21/95:	Made connections be constrained to their solids on project
     		load.  This fixes up hand-edited files and font differences
     		between different systems.
